# CS50 Cyber Problem Set

Welcome to the CS50 Cyber Problem Set! Designed for Harvard University's CS50, taught by Professor David Malan, this problem set introduces students to fundamental cybersecurity concepts through hands-on exercises and conceptual questions.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Misterhoonster/CS50-cyber.git
   ```
   Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd CS50-cyber
   ```

2. **Explore the Parts**:
   - The problem set is divided into three parts: `part1`, `part2`, and `part3`. 
   - Each part has its own directory and README file with detailed instructions and background information.

   To start working on a specific part:
   ```bash
   cd part1
   ```
   Replace `part1` with `part2` or `part3` as needed.

## Problem Set Structure

### 1. READMEs
Each part of the problem set is supported by a detailed README:
- **Parts 2 and 3** include mini-stories where students roleplay as both an attacker and a friend of David Malan.
- READMEs provide clear instructions, background context, and occasional hints to guide students through setup and completion of the exercises. 
- These READMEs are inspired by the comprehensive problem set websites provided for CS263 assignments.

### 2. Backend Design
This problem set uses a backend server implemented with Flask, hosted on Heroku, to enhance the learning experience. The backend generates unique ciphertexts for Part 1 and key-password pairs for Part 2.

### 3. Script Files
To encourage active problem-solving:
- Student-provided Python scripts include `TODO` sections for students to complete.
- Sensitive files, such as `malan_request.py`, are provided in `.pyc` format to prevent reverse-engineering and maintain the integrity of exercises like the network sniffing challenge.

### 4. Conceptual Questions
In addition to coding tasks, the problem set includes conceptual questions to deepen understanding:
- Each part includes reflective questions about the broader motivations and implications of cybersecurity concepts.
- Example: Question 3 challenges students to devise creative ways to impersonate someone online, reinforcing the motivations behind authentication and signing protocols.
