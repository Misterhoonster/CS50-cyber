1. After trying ECB and CTR encryption on an image, what differences do you observe between the resulting encryptions? 
What do you think are the reason for them?

2. Briefly explain how you managed to decrypt the ECB encrypted text using frequency analysis.

3. Would we be able to run a similar frequency analysis on text encrypted with CTR? Why or why not?
